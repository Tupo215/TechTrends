# Techtrends
Project techtrends

TechTrends is an online website used as a news sharing platform that enables users to access the latest news within the cloud-native ecosystem. I was able to extend the project to export and visualize the logs, metrics and status of the application. I applied acquired knowledge to package, store and distribute the code as a Docker image. In its turn, the artifact (or Docker image) was be deployed to a cluster using Kubernetes resources, such as deployments and services. By the end of the project, I was able to use Helm to template the Kubernetes manifests, and automate the TechTrends project release using GitHub Actions and ArgoCD.
